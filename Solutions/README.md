# ciqs-solution-accelerators-backup - Solutions

The 'Solutions' folder contains the most recent, functional ciqs solutions. That's the idea anyway.  

Each solution contains a README.md in its base folder that details the different parts of the solution at a high level. The main inclusions in these README files are:
- A brief description of the solution
- The Manifest(s) used and their 'flow'
- Azure Functions
  + A brief description of the function
  + Inputs to the function
  + Outputs from the function
  + Notable hardcoded values in the code
    + Whether or not these should be hardcoded should be questioned
- ARM templates
  + A brief description of the template
  + Inputs to the template
  + Outputs from the template  
  
Ideally these README files will make understanding and criticism of the Solutions easier, without always having to dive into the actual code and solution files themselves. Particularly in regards to anything marked as 'Hardcoded'. There is a column for this property in most of the tables in the README's.
